What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

_Praise the Lord
His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness
New every morn&#39;
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more_

What patience would wait as we constantly roam
What Father so tender is calling us home
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

What riches of kindness He lavished on us
His blood was the payment His life was the cost
We stood &#39;neath a debt we could never afford
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more
