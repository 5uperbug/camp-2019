Men of faith rise up and sing
Of the great and glorious King
You are strong when you feel weak
In your brokenness complete

_Shout to the north and the south
Sing to the east and the west
Jesus is Savior to all
He&#39;s Lord of heaven and earth_

Rise up women of the truth
Stand and sing to broken hearts
Who can know the healing power
Of our awesome King of love
