When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longin&#39; just to bring
Something that&#39;s of worth
That will bless your heart

_I&#39;ll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the ways things appear
You&#39;re looking into my heart_

_I&#39;m comin&#39; back to the heart of worship
And it&#39;s all about You
It&#39;s all about You, Jesus
I&#39;m sorry Lord for the thing I&#39;ve made it
When it&#39;s all about You
It&#39;s all about You, Jesus_

The King of endless worth
No one could express
How much You deserve? Lord
Though I&#39;m weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath
