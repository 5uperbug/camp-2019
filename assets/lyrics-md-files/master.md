**1. Come Thou fount**

Come, Thou fount of every blessing,
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount! I&#39;m fixed upon it,
mount of thy redeeming love.

Here I raise mine Ebenezer;
hither by thy help I&#39;m come;
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wandering from the fold of God;
he, to rescue me from danger,
interposed his precious blood.

O to grace how great a debtor
daily I&#39;m constrained to be!
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
bind my wandering heart to thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here&#39;s my heart, O take and seal it,
seal it for thy courts above.

**2. As the deer**

As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after thee
You alone are my heart&#39;s desire
And I long to worship thee

_You alone are my strength, my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart&#39;s desire
And I long to worship thee_

You&#39;re my friend and you are my brother
Even though you are a king
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything

I want you more than gold or silver,
only you can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy giver
and the apple of my eye.

**3. Bless the Lord oh my soul**

_Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul, worship his holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I&#39;ll worship your holy name_

The sun comes up, it&#39;s a new day dawning
It&#39;s time to sing your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

You&#39;re rich in love and you&#39;re slow to anger
Your name is great and your heart is kind
For all your goodness, I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

**4. Indescribable**

From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Creation&#39;s revealing Your majesty
From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
All exclaiming

_Indescribable, uncontainable,
You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
You are amazing God
All powerful, untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God_

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom

Indescribable, uncontainable…….
Incomparable, unchangeable
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
You are amazing God
You are amazing God

**5. Because He lives**

God sent his son, They called him Jesus
He came to love, Heal and forgive
He lived and died, To buy my pardon
An empty grave, Is there to prove
My Savior lives

_Because he lives, I can face tomorrow
Because he lives, All fear is gone
Because I know, He holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives_
How sweet to hold, A newborn baby
And feel the pride, And joy he gives
But greater still, The calm assurance
This child can face, Uncertain days
Just Because he lives

And then one day, I&#39;ll cross the river
I&#39;ll fight life&#39;s final war with pain
And then as death, Gives way to victory
I&#39;ll see the lights of glory and
I&#39;ll know he lives

**6. Lovely Lord**

You are filled with compassion and mercy and grace
With Your banner of love over me
I am longing to see You one day face to face
And to be with You endlessly
Lord, how lovely You are to me

_Lovely Lord, You are all to me
Lovely Lord, Full of purity
Worthy of honor and majesty
Lord, how lovely You are to me_

You are bright as the sunrise and fairest of all
Unto You all the glory will be
You are God of creation and Lord of my life
I will worship You faithfully
Lord, how lovely You are to me

We will worship the name of the Holiest One
We will worship Your Excellency
We will give You the glory
For things You have done
And be thankfully eternally
Lord, how lovely You are to me

**7. Heart of Worship**

When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longin&#39; just to bring
Something that&#39;s of worth
That will bless your heart

_I&#39;ll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the ways things appear
You&#39;re looking into my heart_

_I&#39;m comin&#39; back to the heart of worship
And it&#39;s all about You
It&#39;s all about You, Jesus
I&#39;m sorry Lord for the thing I&#39;ve made it
When it&#39;s all about You
It&#39;s all about You, Jesus_

The King of endless worth
No one could express
How much You deserve? Lord
Though I&#39;m weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath

**8. How deep**

How deep the Father&#39;s love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure

How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts, no power, no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

Why should I gain from His reward?
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

**9. Love is deep**

_Your love is deep, Your love is high
Your love is long, long, Your love is wide_

Your love is deeper than my view of grace
Higher than this worldly place
Longer than this road I&#39;ve traveled
Wider than the gap You&#39;ve filled

Deeper than my view of grace
Higher than this worldly place
Longer than this road I&#39;ve traveled
Wider than the gap You&#39;ve filled

Who shall separate us
Who shall separate us from Your love
Nothing can separate us
Nothing can separate us from Your love

**10. He is exalted**

He is exalted the King is exalted on High
I will praise Him
He is exalted forever exalted
And I will praise His name

He is the Lord
Forever His truth shall reign
Heaven and Earth
Rejoice in His holy name
He is exalted the King is exalted on high

**11. My Jesus, my Saviour**

My Jesus, My Savior,
Lord there is none like you,
All of my days, I want to praise
The wonders of your mighty love.
My comfort, my shelter,
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship you.

_Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing,
Power and majesty, praise to the King!
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar,
At the sound of your name!
I sing for joy at the work of your hands,
Forever I&#39;ll love you, forever I&#39;ll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you._

**12. Lord I lift your name on high**

Lord I lift your name on high
Lord I love to sing your praises
I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re in my life
I&#39;m so glad you came to save us

_You came from heaven to earth
To show the way
From the earth to the cross
My debt to pay
From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord I lift your name on high_

**13. Your name**

As morning dawns and evening fades
You inspire songs of praise
That rise from earth to touch your heart and glorify Your Name

_Your Name is a strong and mighty tower
Your Name is a shelter like no other
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder
Cause nothing has the power to save
But you&#39;re Name_

Jesus, in Your Name we pray
Come and fill our hearts today
Lord, give us strength to live for you and glorify Your Name

**14. Shout to the north and the south**

Men of faith rise up and sing
Of the great and glorious King
You are strong when you feel weak
In your brokenness complete

_Shout to the north and the south
Sing to the east and the west
Jesus is Savior to all
He&#39;s Lord of heaven and earth_

Rise up women of the truth
Stand and sing to broken hearts
Who can know the healing power
Of our awesome King of love

**15. Our Father**

Hear our prayer
We are your children
And we&#39;ve gathered here today, bless me
We&#39;re gathered here to pray
Hear our cry
Lord, we need your mercy
And we need your grace today, yes, we do
Hear us as we pray

_Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray_

Hear our song
As it rises to Heaven
May your glory fill the earth
As the waters cover the seas
See our hearts
And remove anything
That is standing in the way
Of coming to you today
And though we are few

We&#39;re surrounded by many
Who have crossed that river before
And this is the song we&#39;ll be singing forever
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord

**16. Are you washed in the blood**

Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

_Are you washed in the blood?
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?_

Are you walking daily by the Savior&#39;s side?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright?
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;
There&#39;s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
Oh, be washed in the blood of the Lamb!

**17. Fairest Lord Jesus**

Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,
O Thou of God and man the Son,
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,
Thou, my soul&#39;s glory, joy and crown.

Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

Fair is the sunshine,
Fairer still the moonlight,
And all the twinkling starry host;
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels&#39; heaven can boast.

All fairest beauty, heavenly and earthly,
Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;
None can be nearer, fairer or dearer,
Than Thou, my Savior, art to me.

Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations!
Son of God and Son of Man!
Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
Now and forever more be Thine

**18. I am Thine oh Lord**

I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice,
And it told thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to thee.

_Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where thou hast died.
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To thy precious, bleeding side._

Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in thine.

O the pure delight of a single hour
That before thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with thee.

**19. Great is Thy faithfulness**

Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

_Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness!&quot;
 Morning by morning new mercies I see;
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me!_

Summer and winter, springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!

**20. Above all powers**

Above all powers, Above all kings
Above all nature, And all created things
Above all wisdom, And all the ways of man
You were here, Before the world began

Above all kingdoms, Above all thrones
Above all wonders, The world has ever known
Above all wealth, And treasures of the earth
There&#39;s no way to measure, What you&#39;re worth

_Crucified, Laid behind a stone
You lived to die, Rejected and alone
Like a rose, Trampled on the ground
You took the fall, And thought of me
Above all_

**21. Jesus Paid it all**

I hear the Savior say,
&quot;Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me Thine all in all.&quot;

_Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow._

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I&#39;ll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary&#39;s Lamb.

And now complete in Him,
My robe, His righteousness,
Close sheltered &#39;neath His side,
I am divinely blest.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow&#39;r, and Thine alone,
Can change the \*leper&#39;s spots
And melt the heart of stone.

When from my dying bed
My ransomed soul shall rise,
&quot;Jesus died my soul to save,&quot;
Shall rend the vaulted skies.

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
I&#39;ll lay my trophies down,
All down at Jesus&#39; feet.

**22.  How great is our God**

The splendor of a king, Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice, All the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light, And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice, Trembles at His voice

_How great is our God, Sing with me
How great is our God, And all will see
How great, how great is our God_

Age to age He stands, And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end, Beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One, Father, Spirit, Son
Lion and the Lamb, Lion and the Lamb

Name above all names, Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing, How great is our God
Name above all names, You are worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing, How great is our God...

**23. Everlasting God**

Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord

_Our God, You reign forever
Our hope, our Strong Deliverer
You are the everlasting God
The everlasting God
You do not faint
You won&#39;t grow weary_

You&#39;re the defender of the weak
You comfort those in need
You lift us up on wings like eagles

**24. Forever**

Give thanks to the Lord our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise [2x]

With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that&#39;s been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise [2x]

_Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever..._

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
And by the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise [2x]

**25. Lord I lift Your name on high**

Lord, I lift Your name on high
Lord, I love to sing Your praises
I&#39;m so glad You&#39;re in my life
I&#39;m so glad You came to save us

_You came from heaven to earth
To show the way
From the earth to the cross
My debt to pay
From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord, I lift Your name on high_

**26. Come people of the risen King**

Come, people of the risen King
Who delight to bring Him praise
Come all and tune your hearts to sing
To the morning star of grace
From the shifting shadows of the earth
We will lift our eyes to Him
Where steady arms of mercy reach
To gather children in
Rejoice, rejoice
Let every tongue rejoice
One heart one voice
Oh, church of Christ rejoice

Come those whose joy is morning sun
And those weeping through the night
Come those who tell of battles won
And those struggling in the fight

For His perfect love will never change
And His mercies never cease
But follow us through all our days
With the certain hope of peace
Come, young and old from every land
Men and women of the faith
Come those with full or empty hands
Find the riches of His grace
Over all the world His people sing
Shore to shore we hear them call
The truth that cries through every age
Our God is all in all

**27. By faith**

By faith we see the hand of God
In the light of creation&#39;s grand design
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness
Who walk by faith and not by sight

By faith our fathers roamed the earth
With the power of His promise in their hearts
Of a holy city built by God&#39;s own hand
A place where peace and justice reign

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul&#39;s reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We&#39;ll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for Messiah would appear
With the power to break the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant from the grave

By faith the church was called to go
In the power of the Spirit to the lost
To deliver captives and to preach good news
In every corner of the earth
We will stand...

By faith this mountain shall be moved
And the power of the gospel shall prevail
For we know in Christ all things are possible
For all who call upon His name
We will stand...

**28. You are beautiful beyond description**

You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words
Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom
Who can fathom the depths of Your love
You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty, enthroned above

_And I stand, I stand in awe of You
I stand, I stand in awe of You
Holy God to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of You_

You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words
Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom
Who can fathom the depths of Your love
You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty, enthroned above

**29. Our God is greater**

Water you turned into wine,
Opened the eyes of the blind there&#39;s no one like you, none like You!
Into the darkness you shine,
Out of the ashes we rise there&#39;s no one like you none like You!

_Our God is greater, our God is stronger, God you are higher than any other.
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power, Our God! Our God!_

Into the darkness you shine,
Out of the ashes we rise there&#39;s no one like you, none like You!

And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us, then what could stand against.
What could stand against.

**30. Elshadai Aaradhana**

Tere jaisa kaun hain
Jo mera bhala kare
Mera bharosa sirf tujhpar prabhu
Mere jeevan ka swami
Adhaar bana tu prabhuji
Tu nahi toh mera jeevan
Vyarth ho… jayega

_Elshadai aaradhana
Elohim aaradhana
Adonai aaradhana
Yeshua aaradhana_

Bechaini mein mujhe paakar
Aansu mere poche tune
Aakhoan ki putli jaise
Jeevan bhar sambhala mujhe
Mrityu ke raaste par
Tute dil ko liye khadaa tha
Changa karne waala bankar
Mujhe naya jeevan diya

**31. Ashisho Se Baharane Vala**

Ashisho se baharane vala
Mera Sundar pita hai vo
chalta rahu uski rahe me
Mujhe vo shanti dega
Sone se bi sresht hai vo
Meri tu roshni hai
Tu hi hai Bada mahan
Yeshu mere Raja....

_Bhedo ke jaise me kho gaya tha
Koi na tha sahara
Tu aaya charvaha banke
Or Mujhe khoj liya_

Suli par mara gaya
Vo sab mere liye tha
Saare kasto ko tu sahaa
Mujhe bachane ko
Khud ko me arpan karu
Tere pass me aata hu
Or kya de sakta hu
Harpal me tera hi hu

Andyare se tune mujhe
Jyoti me leke ayaaa
Karu me teri mahima hardin
Kyunki tu hi hai mahan.
karta rahu tujh par vishwas
Tu hi hai meri ashaa
pyaar toh me tuj se karu
Tu he hai meri chataan.

**32. His Mercy is More**

What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

_Praise the Lord
His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness
New every morn&#39;
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more_

What patience would wait as we constantly roam
What Father so tender is calling us home
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

What riches of kindness He lavished on us
His blood was the payment His life was the cost
We stood &#39;neath a debt we could never afford
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more

**33.  I Can only Imagine**

I can only imagine
What it would be like
When I walk by your side

I can only imagine
What my eyes would see
When your face is before me
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

_Surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or in awe of You be still
Will I stand in your presence
To my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all_

_I can only imagine
I can only imagine_

I can only imagine
When that day comes
When I find myself
Standing in the Son

I can only imagine
When all I will do
Is forever, forever worship you
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

**34. Jesus, Thank You**

The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
The agonies of Calvary
You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me

_Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father&#39;s wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You_

By Your perfect sacrifice I&#39;ve been brought near
Your enemy You&#39;ve made Your friend
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end

Lover of my soul
I want to live for You

**35. He Hideth My Soul**

A wonderful saviour is Jesus my Lord
A wonderful Saviour to me
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
Where rivers of pleasure I see

_He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land
He hideth my life in the depths of his love
And covers me there with his hand
And covers me there with his hand_

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord
He taketh my burden a-way
He hodelth me up and I shall not be moved
He giveth me strength as my day

When clothed in His brightness
Transported I rise
To meet Him in Clouds of the sky
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love
I&#39;ll shout with the millions on high

Though the nations rage, kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King reigning over all
So I will not fear for this truth remains:
That my God is, the Ancient of Days

_None above Him, none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power, all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days_

Though the dread of night overwhelms my soul
He is here with me, I am not alone
O His love is sure, and He knows my name
For my God is, the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see what the future brings
I will watch and wait for the Saviour King
Then my joy complete standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

**43. O God Beyond All Praising**

O God beyond all praising,
we worship you today
and sing the love amazing
that songs cannot repay;
for we can only wonder
at every gift you send,
at blessings without number
and mercies without end:
we lift our hearts before you
and wait upon your word,
we honor and adore you,
our great and mighty Lord.

The flower of earthly splendor
in time must surely die,
its fragile bloom surrender
to you the Lord most high;
but hidden from all nature
the eternal seed is sown -
though small in mortal stature,
to heaven&#39;s garden grown:
for Christ the Man from heaven
from death has set us free,
and we through him are given
the final victory!

Then hear, O gracious Savior,
accept the love we bring,
that we who know your favor
may serve you as our king;
and whether our tomorrows
be filled with good or ill,
we&#39;ll triumph through our sorrows
and rise to bless you still:
to marvel at your beauty
and glory in your ways,
and make a joyful duty
our sacrifice of praise.

**46. God Sent His Son/ Daivathin Puthranam**

God sent his son, They called him Jesus
He came to love, Heal and forgive
He lived and died, To buy my pardon
An empty grave, Is there to prove
My Savior lives

Daivathin puthranam Yeshu bhujathanayi
Snehippan kshamippan sawkhyam nalkiduvan
Jeevichu marichavan enne rakshippanai
Ennum jeevikunnavanene karuthan

_Than vazkayal aakulamilla
Naleyenna bhethiyilla
Bhaviyellam than kayyilennorthal
Ha Ethra dhanameyen lokajeevitham_

_Because he lives, I can face tomorrow
Because he lives, All fear is gone
Because I know, He holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives_
How sweet to hold, A newborn baby
And feel the pride, And joy he gives
But greater still, The calm assurance
This child can face, Uncertain days
Just Because he lives

Anadanalla njan asharanalla njan
Avakashiyanu njan paradeshiyanu njan
Athyunnnathan than thirumarvil
nithyavum charidum najan ennum modamay

And then one day, I&#39;ll cross the river
I&#39;ll fight life&#39;s final war with pain
And then as death, Gives way to victory
I&#39;ll see the lights of glory and
I&#39;ll know he lives

**48. Hallelujah for The Cross**

Up to the hill of Calvary
My Savior went courageously
and there he bled and died for me
Hallelujah for the cross
And on that day the world was changed
A final, perfect lamb was slain
Let earth and heaven now proclaim
Hallelujah for the cross

_Hallelujah for the war He fought
Love has won, death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls He bought
Hallelujah for the cross_

What good I&#39;ve done could never save
My debt too great for deeds to pay
But God, my Savior, made a way
Hallelujah for the cross
A slave to sin, my life was bound
But all my chains fell to the ground
When Jesus&#39; blood came flowing down
Hallelujah for the cross

(Hallelujah, hallelujah)

And when I breathe my final breath
I&#39;ll have no need to fear that rest
This hope will guide me into death
Hallelujah for the cross

**49. Be Thou My Vision**

Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, thy presence my light

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father, Thine own may I be
Thou in me dwelling and I one with Thee

Riches I heed not, nor vain, empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art

Lord, You are more precious than silver
Lord, You are more costly than gold
Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds
And nothing I desire compares with You

High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heaven&#39;s joys, O bright heaven&#39;s sun
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all

**50. My Redeemer&#39;s Love**

My Redeemer&#39;s love is deeper
Than the depths of sin and hell
He who was enthroned in glory
Came to bring us to Himself
My Redeemer&#39;s love is wider
Than the breach my sins had made
He reached down into my darkness
He alone has power to save

_Deeper than the rolling seas
Higher than the mountain peaks
Your love is all I need_

My Redeemer&#39;s love is stronger
Than my fiercest enemies
He will hold me in the tempest
Through the flood He carries me
My Redeemer&#39;s love will lead me
Through the deepest valley here
He will shepherd me and guide me
He will ever keep me near

_Deeper than the rolling seas
Higher than the mountain peaks
Your love is all I need
Stronger than the rushing wind
Shattering the power of sin
Your love is all I need_

My Redeemer&#39;s love grows sweeter
As eternity draws near
I&#39;ll enjoy His love forever
At His throne for endless years
My Redeemer&#39;s love will fill me
On the day I see His face
I will love Him back forever
And forever sing His praise

Hail Jesus! You&#39;re my King!
Your life frees me to sing
I will praise You all my days
You&#39;re perfect in all Your ways

Hail Jesus! You&#39;re my Lord!

Because I want to see Your kingdom come
Not my will but Yours be done

Glory, glory to the Lamb!
You will take us into the land
We will conquer in Your name
And proclaim that &quot;Jesus reigns!&quot;

_Hail, hail! Lion of Judah!
How wonderful You are!
Hail, hail! Lion of Judah!
How powerful You are!_
