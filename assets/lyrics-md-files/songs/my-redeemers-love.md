My Redeemer&#39;s love is deeper
Than the depths of sin and hell
He who was enthroned in glory
Came to bring us to Himself
My Redeemer&#39;s love is wider
Than the breach my sins had made
He reached down into my darkness
He alone has power to save

_Deeper than the rolling seas
Higher than the mountain peaks
Your love is all I need_

My Redeemer&#39;s love is stronger
Than my fiercest enemies
He will hold me in the tempest
Through the flood He carries me
My Redeemer&#39;s love will lead me
Through the deepest valley here
He will shepherd me and guide me
He will ever keep me near

_Deeper than the rolling seas
Higher than the mountain peaks
Your love is all I need
Stronger than the rushing wind
Shattering the power of sin
Your love is all I need_

My Redeemer&#39;s love grows sweeter
As eternity draws near
I&#39;ll enjoy His love forever
At His throne for endless years
My Redeemer&#39;s love will fill me
On the day I see His face
I will love Him back forever
And forever sing His praise
