As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after thee
You alone are my heart&#39;s desire
And I long to worship thee

_You alone are my strength, my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart&#39;s desire
And I long to worship thee_

You&#39;re my friend and you are my brother
Even though you are a king
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything

I want you more than gold or silver,
only you can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy giver
and the apple of my eye.
