_Your love is deep, Your love is high
Your love is long, long, Your love is wide_

Your love is deeper than my view of grace
Higher than this worldly place
Longer than this road I&#39;ve traveled
Wider than the gap You&#39;ve filled

Deeper than my view of grace
Higher than this worldly place
Longer than this road I&#39;ve traveled
Wider than the gap You&#39;ve filled

Who shall separate us
Who shall separate us from Your love
Nothing can separate us
Nothing can separate us from Your love
