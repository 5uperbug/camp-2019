I hear the Savior say,
&quot;Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me Thine all in all.&quot;

_Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow._

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I&#39;ll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary&#39;s Lamb.

And now complete in Him,
My robe, His righteousness,
Close sheltered &#39;neath His side,
I am divinely blest.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow&#39;r, and Thine alone,
Can change the \*leper&#39;s spots
And melt the heart of stone.

When from my dying bed
My ransomed soul shall rise,
&quot;Jesus died my soul to save,&quot;
Shall rend the vaulted skies.

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
I&#39;ll lay my trophies down,
All down at Jesus&#39; feet.
