The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
The agonies of Calvary
You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me

_Your blood has washed away my sin
Jesus, thank You
The Father&#39;s wrath completely satisfied
Jesus, thank You
Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
Jesus, thank You_

By Your perfect sacrifice I&#39;ve been brought near
Your enemy You&#39;ve made Your friend
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end

Lover of my soul
I want to live for You
