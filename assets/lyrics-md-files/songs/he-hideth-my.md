A wonderful saviour is Jesus my Lord
A wonderful Saviour to me
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
Where rivers of pleasure I see

_He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land
He hideth my life in the depths of his love
And covers me there with his hand
And covers me there with his hand_

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord
He taketh my burden a-way
He hodelth me up and I shall not be moved
He giveth me strength as my day

When clothed in His brightness
Transported I rise
To meet Him in Clouds of the sky
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love
I&#39;ll shout with the millions on high
