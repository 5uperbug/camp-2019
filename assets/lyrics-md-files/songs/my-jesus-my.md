My Jesus, My Savior,
Lord there is none like you,
All of my days, I want to praise
The wonders of your mighty love.
My comfort, my shelter,
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship you.

_Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing,
Power and majesty, praise to the King!
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar,
At the sound of your name!
I sing for joy at the work of your hands,
Forever I&#39;ll love you, forever I&#39;ll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you._
