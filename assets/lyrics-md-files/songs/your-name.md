As morning dawns and evening fades
You inspire songs of praise
That rise from earth to touch your heart and glorify Your Name

_Your Name is a strong and mighty tower
Your Name is a shelter like no other
Your Name, let the nations sing it louder
Cause nothing has the power to save
But you&#39;re Name_

Jesus, in Your Name we pray
Come and fill our hearts today
Lord, give us strength to live for you and glorify Your Name
