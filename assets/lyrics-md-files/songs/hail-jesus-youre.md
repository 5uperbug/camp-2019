Hail Jesus! You&#39;re my King!
Your life frees me to sing
I will praise You all my days
You&#39;re perfect in all Your ways

Hail Jesus! You&#39;re my Lord!
I will obey Your word
Because I want to see Your kingdom come
Not my will but Yours be done

Glory, glory to the Lamb!
You will take us into the land
We will conquer in Your name
And proclaim that &quot;Jesus reigns!&quot;

_Hail, hail! Lion of Judah!
How wonderful You are!
Hail, hail! Lion of Judah!
How powerful You are!_
