Give thanks to the Lord our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise [2x]

With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that&#39;s been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise [2x]

_Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever..._

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
And by the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise [2x]
