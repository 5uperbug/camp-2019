God sent his son, They called him Jesus
He came to love, Heal and forgive
He lived and died, To buy my pardon
An empty grave, Is there to prove
My Savior lives

_Because he lives, I can face tomorrow
Because he lives, All fear is gone
Because I know, He holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives_
How sweet to hold, A newborn baby
And feel the pride, And joy he gives
But greater still, The calm assurance
This child can face, Uncertain days
Just Because he lives

And then one day, I&#39;ll cross the river
I&#39;ll fight life&#39;s final war with pain
And then as death, Gives way to victory
I&#39;ll see the lights of glory and
I&#39;ll know he lives
